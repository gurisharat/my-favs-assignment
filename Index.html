 <h2 class="purple">THE NBA</h2>
 
 <p>Being a basketball person I obviously watch the NBA. 
  My favorite team is thhe Golden state warriors. my favorite players stephen curry 
 Watching and supporting your team feels great especially when they make a deep playoff run. 
 the warriors won the championship in 2022 after two years of being horrible. The feeling was 
 great it felt as if i was on the team. </p>
